Did you know that a conventional pad consists of 90% plastic? The leak-proof bottom layer, and polymer powder that acts as an absorbent are all plastic! In addition, the cotton used is bleached to make it extraordinarily white. All this plastic and chemicals make sanitary pads an unhealthy, rather dangerous choice for frequent use. Your vaginal pH level is disturbed, rashes, bacterial growth and infections are caused because of these seemingly harmless products. The effects go even deeper, as embryonic development is affected by the chemicals such as BPA used in sanitary pads.

On top of all this, an average woman uses over 7000 pads in her lifetime and disposes them all in landfills, or flushes them down toilet drains. This means, if all Pakistani women of ages 15 years and above are menstruating, a total of 82,570,202 x 15 pads are disposed off EVERY month. This poses a huge burden on the environment, as plastic (and thus pads, and tampons too btw) is non-biodegradable. The plastic does NOT dissolve in the ground for over 500 years. Added to this, soiled pads when left open in landfills cause diseases to trash-pickers and the people living in nearby areas. How do you feel about this? I know I did not feel good at all. That is why, I switched to Recircle Cup.

Recircle Cup is made of silicone which is chemically unreactive, and hence does not harm your vagina and your health. You might think silicone is also not biodegradable, but this single cup can be used for upto 10 years! This means I will be dumping a total of 4 cups (given I menstruate for 40 years in my lifetime), compared to 7000 + sanitary pads/tampons. THAT makes me feel good!

It was difficult at first for to imagine inserting this cup up my vagina, and my mom (like any desi mom) outrightly rejected the idea. However, when I actually tried it, it was not difficult at all. Infact, once the cup was in me, I could BARELY tell if anything was inside me- it’s that great! I sometimes forget I’m even on my period because the cup can prevent leakage for up to 12 hours.

Being a woman, I know period makes you feel cranky and annoyed and putting a sanitary pad in your underwear is more convenient than inserting a cup in you. However, I do this for my body and the environment above anything else. We can help make this process very easy for you with our blogs, if you want to try! I do not regret using a menstrual cup, and I hope you don’t as well.

Lots of love,
