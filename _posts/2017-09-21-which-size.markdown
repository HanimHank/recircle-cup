**Choosing the right size**

*If you are sexually inactive:* Use a Small Cup.

*If you are sexually active:* For light flow, use a Small Cup. For heavy flow, use a Large Cup.

*If you have given birth:* Use a Large Cup.

**Details**

If you are a virgin, we would recommend you start by using our small cup. This is because your vaginal muscles
will be tighter, and inserting a bigger cup might be difficult.

The size also affects the capacity of the cup. If you have light to medium flow, you should use our small
cup. If you have a heavy flow, use our large cup. Please know that the large Recircle cup is only
slightly larger in diameter than the small Recircle cup, so itâ€™s not going to be that big a difference for you to change
sizes. If you have given birth vaginally, we recommend you use the large cup because after giving birth your
vaginal muscles become weak and so a large cup would hold itself properly in place more easily.

**Flow measure**

Light Flow: If you change a pad after every 7 - 8 hours during your period

Medium Flow: If you change a pad every 4 - 6 hours during your period

Heavy Flow: If you change your pad every 1- 3 hours during your period
