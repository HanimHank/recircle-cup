Not quite long ago I was intrigued by this product and read numerous articles to find out what it was and how
it worked. So if you have no idea what a menstrual cup is, I've got your back! (I think we owe it our society
where talking about menstruation makes aunties go 'haw-haye').

A menstrual cup is a feminine hygiene product just like sanitary pads and tampons are. It's is a bell-shaped
cup that has to be [folded](/folds) and [inserted](/start) in your vagina, sitting just below your
cervix. You boil it before use, empty after it's full (up to 12 hours), then wash and reinsert it. It is made of
medical grade silicone, making it re-usable and an environment-friendly option.

You might think a menstrual cup is similar to a tampon, but there are two main differences between a tampon and
a menstrual cup.

1)	Menstrual cups are re-usable while tampons are not.

2)	Tampons absorb menstrual fluid with the help of a chemical *absorbent*, while menstrual cups collect menstrual
fluid inside them. This is also why it is advised to change a tampon every 4 hours, as the absorbent can be harmful.
Menstrual cups can be left inside for up to 12 hours.

The best thing about a menstrual cup is that it seals inside your vagina, so you can even swim with it! Menstrual
cups come in different [sizes](/which-size) and designs so you can select the one that fits your vagina best, as every vagina
is different.
