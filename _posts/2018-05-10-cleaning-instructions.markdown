1. Boil your Recircle Cup in clean water for 3-5 minutes every time before your period starts and after it ends.
We recommend using drinking water for boiling the cup and not regular tap water.

2. During your period, wash the cup with clean water and our oil-free, pH balanced Organic Recircle Cup Wash.
If you are using soap for washing, it is recommended that you use an oil-free and fragrance-free soap, to ensure the material of your cup
is not compromised and the pH of your vagina is not affected either.


3. When washing the cup, wash it with cold clean water first and then hot water to avoid stains setting in the silicone.


4. If you notice the colour going light or stains setting in, donâ€™t worry about it. Silicone does inevitably lose its colour. But you can
keep your cup under the sun once a month to delay discolouration.


5. Make sure you clean the air holes of your cup every month. Use a toothpick or an old toothbrush for this purpose.


6. Your Recircle Cup needs to breathe! Please avoid keeping your menstrual cup in an airtight container. Store your cup in the breathable,
unbleached, cotton pouch we send it to you in, because depriving it of oxygen can compromise the quality of the material. The pouch can
be washed too! If you lose your pouch, you can always request us to send you a new one (delivery cost will be charged).
