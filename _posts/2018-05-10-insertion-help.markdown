Recircle Cup is a relatively soft menstrual cup that is easy to insert and remove. However, sometimes it can be a bit of a challenge to get the cup to open up inside your vagina. Here are the top two reasons why this can happen:

* You have strong pelvic floor muscles due to exercise or excessive physical activity.
* You are not relaxed while insertion, and so your vaginal walls push against the cup too hard for it to open up easily.

Here is what you can do to help yourself:

1. Try several folds to find out which is easiest for you personally to work with. Remember, every vagina is different! The punch down fold is the best one for me. You can find three basic folds here.

2.  Once 3/4th of the cup is inside your vagina, push the un-folded edge down towards the folded edge, and the cup will pop open.

3.  Rotate the base of the cup 2-3 times once it is inside you.

4.  Once the cup is inside, pull on the base a little (not too much! Don’t pull the cup out), and push it back in.

5.  After the cup is inside, squat 2-3 times. That helps the cup to adjust its position, and open up.

6.  Once the cup is inside you, you can ensure that the fold is open by putting a finger in your vagina while the cup is in and feeling the cup’s walls and the rim. If you feel the cup is not open, you can use your finger to open it inside. This is easier for women who have given birth vaginally.

7.  Final tip: be patient! It takes some time for new users of menstrual cups to get familiar with cup usage- and work out a way for themselves.
If nothing works for you, you should definitely need to try another menstrual cup brand which is firmer!
