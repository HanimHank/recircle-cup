Two years after launching Recircle, we are offering a completely new design of our menstrual cup and discontinuing 
the old design. The improved design offers the following benefits:

* The new Recircle Cup is ‘U-shaped’ rather than ‘V-shaped’ which allows it to have a larger capacity 
than the old design. 

* The new Recircle Cup has a longer and sturdier stem which allows women with a high cervix to use it too. 
Women with a lower cervix can cut the stem to adjust the length that fits them best. 

* The new Recircle Cup is firmer which allows it to open up more easily inside your vagina. 

* The new Recircle Cup has more pronounced grip rings which makes it easier to insert and remove. 

We are confident that you will like the changes! Give it a try and let us know about your experience.
