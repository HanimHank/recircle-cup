One question that we usually get asked is whether Recircle Cup can be used if you have an Intrauterine Device (IUD)/Copper T 
placed in your uterus to avoid pregnancy. The simple answer to this is **yes, you can**! Let’s go into the details now. 

This question is common because many women fear that removing their menstrual cup will cause IUD expulsion. This is a 
genuine fear because the suction created by a menstrual cup can be quite strong, and you might think the removal process 
might end up sucking the IUD with the cup.

However, according to a comparative study by Ellen R Weibe and Konia J Trouton 
for Department of Family Practice “Does Using Tampons or Menstrual Cups Increase IUD Expulsion Rates”, no evidence was 
found that a menstrual cup is more likely to cause IUD expulsion. (Source: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22464406/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22464406/)). 

It is important to note that IUD expulsion is possible, with or without a menstrual cup. The percentage of women who 
experience expulsion, however, is low (between 0.5%- 10%) and depends on various factors. IUD expulsion is most common 
in younger female (14-19 year olds) and women who got the IUD inserted right after giving birth. Women who recently 
have had an abortion might also have higher chances of an IUD being expelled.  (Source: 
[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4172535/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4172535/)). 
Also, IUD expulsion is most common in the first three months 
of the IUD being inserted (Source:

To get some local data on the issue, we recently did a small survey on our Instagram some time ago where we asked if 
women with IUDs faced difficulty using a menstrual cup, or faced dislodging issues. Although the number of women who 
replied to this survey was small, no one reported dislodging. One user, Mahvish Waqar, said *“I just have to remember 
to break the seal before taking out the cup. Other than that, it doesn’t feel any different from when I didn’t have 
an IUD in”*. 

Wasma Imran, the co-founder of Recircle, who has been using Recircle Cup with the IUD for a few months, says “I just
 try to be careful not to pull on my IUD strings when removing my Recircle Cup. Rest is all great! My latest visit to 
 my OBGYN showed that my IUD is perfectly in its place.”

From conversations around IUD use with menstrual cups, we have managed to put together some tips for you, in case you 
are also afraid of dislodging your IUD while using Recircle Cup. 

**Tips for Menstrual Cup Use with an IUD in Place**
1. To make sure the chances of expulsion are minimized, start using your menstrual cup 2-3 months after getting an IUD 
inserted. This will help your uterus get adjusted to the IUD.
2. You can ask your OBGYN to cut the strings of your IUD short, to ensure you do not pull on them when removing your 
menstrual cup. 
3. When removing your menstrual cup, you should break the seal as soon as you get a hold of the base of the cup to 
avoid creating a ‘pulling’ effect in your vagina. 
4. Try to ensure you aren’t pulling on your IUD strings when you remove your menstrual cup. 
5. Ask your OBGYN to teach you how to ensure your IUD is in place. Some ways you can find out your IUD has moved or 
has been partially/fully expelled can be found [here](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322290)
6. After using a menstrual cup for 1-2 months, you can pay a visit to your OBGYN and get a checkup/an ultrasound to 
ensure your IUD is in place.
